# TeamsWP

Teams client for Windows Phone

## Building / running
Everything should be in `TeamsWP.sln`; needs VS2017 (not newer)

## Usage
I don't know how you can install it on your phone if you don't know how Visual Studio works. 
I'm not that far in understanding all of this just yet.
If someone knows how to build a... thing? App package? Idk? Something I can upload, let me know.
